# HelloWorldJava


My first time in teaching myself how to be a software engineer, they usually say start with Hello world.
I guess, this is way to test your understanding of the language.
And if you think about it, when learning a new language, we usually start with the greetings.

# WhatAmLearningSoFar
- Having used python to print Hello world, it is different from Java. 
- with Java, there is a class. the name of the class must match, "name of the file"
- for the program to run, there must be public static void main(String[] args)
- {} are very important in java
- ; are very important as well. i guess are what i define as closing the line.
